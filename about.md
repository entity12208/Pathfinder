# Pathfinder (single-file)
Single-file Pathfinder-inspired mod for Geometry Dash using Geode.
- Attempts to extract the current level objects if available.
- Falls back to `level.txt` in the mod save directory if needed.
- Produces `macro.txt` (newline-separated frames) and `pathfinder_report.txt` for debugging.
Build with `geode build` after setting up the Geode SDK as documented at docs.geode-sdk.org.
